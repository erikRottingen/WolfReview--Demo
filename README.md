# WolfReview--Demo
Full code and testing done by me.  GUI provided by staff, Dr. Sarah Heckman and Dr. Chandrika Satyavolu. Demo for WolfReview Project, which is used to help manage the process of reviewing papers for a Computer Science Education Conference.
The Program allows for the user to make either a new Paper Track of academic papers, or upload an existing paper track.
When the program runs on the GUI, it starts with a unfilled in screen:

When the user selects an existing paper track file, the GUI returns a filled in screen.

The user can then select certain papers to determine whether the paper can be added to the conference or not.  In order to be added to the conference, the paper must go from the submitted state as an abstract paper, to the reviewing state, back to the submitted state to submit a full paper, back to the reviewing state, and then registering state, and finally, when the paper has been approved to enter the conference, the paper ends in the closed state.

To change from state to state, the client reviews the paper and determines whether the the paper is accepted or rejected.
